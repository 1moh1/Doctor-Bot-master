®< Skin Diseases System >® 🩺🤖 Our graduation project was titled "Doctor Bot" - a smart and innovative solution to facilitate the medical diagnosis of skin diseases using artificial intelligence technologies. 📌 The project idea was based on a genuine desire to provide accurate and rapid primary medical services that help people identify their health condition without the need to visit a doctor in the first stage, especially in remote or limited-capacity areas. 🔍 System Features: ✅ It enables diagnosis by uploading a photo or writing a description of symptoms ✅ Powered by artificial intelligence trained on more than 30,000 images of skin diseases ✅ Covers more than 7 common diseases with excellent accuracy ✅ Relies on reliable scientific models for analyzing images and texts ✅ Easy to use, saves time and cost ✅ Can be interacted with directly through chat to explain the condition ✅ Does not require direct medical intervention initially, which speeds up the initial examination steps 🎯 Our primary goal: To provide a smart tool that contributes to improving access to healthcare, with high quality and a simple interface accessible to everyone.
